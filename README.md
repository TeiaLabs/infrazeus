In this repo you will find the foundation scripts for divine cloud structures with AWS CloudFormation. 

## Getting Started

InfraZeus is a powerful tool designed to simplify the creation and management of your AWS infrastructure for deploying applications. It supports operations such as creating Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repositories, Elastic Load Balancers (ALB), and Elastic Container Service (ECS) tasks. Follow the instructions below to get started with InfraZeus.

### Set Up InfraZeus

Firstly, you need to clone the repository and install InfraZeus as a Python module:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:TeiaLabs/infrazeus.git
cd infrazeus
pip install .
```

### Basic Usage

Use the InfraZeus tool by running it as a Python module with the following syntax:

```bash
python -m infrazeus <COMMAND> [OPTIONS]...
```

### Available Commands

Here is a list of available commands that InfraZeus supports:

- `alb`: Manage Application Load Balancers, with options to create, list, and describe stacks.
- `ecr`: Manage Elastic Container Registries, allowing you to create and list repositories.
- `ecs`: Manage Elastic Container Service tasks, including the creation, listing, and stack description.
- `parameters`: Handle environment parameters, offering creation and listing capabilities.

## Creating Infrastructure with InfraZeus

Using InfraZeus, you can seamlessly create an ECR repository, Application Load Balancers with SSL certification, and an ECS task for your application's Docker container. This includes automated environment variable management.

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

- A Docker image of your application.
- A `.env` file containing the production-ready environment variables.
- Configured AWS credentials.
- The necessary IAM permissions to create AWS resources such as ECR, ECS, Secrets Manager, ALB, security groups, and Certificate Manager.
- An SSL certificate for your domain (e.g., *.allai.digital, *.teialabs.com.br, *.osf.digital).

### Workflow Example

Here's an example workflow to illustrate how you can use InfraZeus to set up your infrastructure:

**Step 1: Create the ECR Repository**

Create an ECR repository by specifying the configuration file:

```bash
python -m infrazeus ecr create --file infrasets/service-example.json
```

After creation, push the Docker image to this repository, typically using GitHub Actions or your preferred CI/CD pipeline.

**Step 2: Manage Application Environment Variables**

Upload your application environment variables to the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store and AWS Secrets Manager:

```bash
python -m infrazeus parameters create --file infrasets/service-example.json --env infrasets/service-example.env --secrets MONGODB_URI
```

Specify your secret keys with the `--secrets` option.

**Step 3: Set Up Load Balancers and ECS Task**

Create the necessary Application Load Balancers (ALB) and an ECS task definition:

```bash
python -m infrazeus ecs create --file infrasets/service-example.json
```

**Step 4: Monitor Your Stack**

Check the status of the ECS services and related resources:

```bash
python -m infrazeus ecs describe_stack --file infrasets/service-example.json
```
